This folder contains the results of Murray-Clay et al. (2009).
These are monofrequency EUV, pure H simulations with no bolometric heating/cooling below the wind and different lower boundary conditions.

They were created with the 2009 version of this code and cannot be reproduced with the code in its current form.

The headers of these solutions have been modified to be readable by the latest iteration of Wind-AE.
