	abstract = {We explore atmospheric escape from close-in exoplanets with the highest mass-loss rates. First, we locate the transition from stellar X-ray and UV-driven escape to rapid Roche lobe overflow, which occurs once the 10-100 nbar pressure level in the atmosphere reaches the Roche lobe. Planets enter this regime when the ratio of the substellar radius to the polar radius along the visible surface pressure level, which aligns with a surface of constant Roche potential, is X/Z ≳ 1.2 for Jovian planets (Mp ≳ 100 M ⊕) and X/Z ≳ 1.02 for sub-Jovian planets (M p ≈ 10-100 M ⊕). Around a Sun-like star, this regime applies to orbital periods of less than two days for planets with radii of about 3-14R⊕. Our results agree with the properties of known transiting planets and can explain parts of the sub-Jovian desert in the population of known exoplanets. Second, we present detailed numerical simulations of atmospheric escape from a planet like Uranus or Neptune orbiting close to a Sun-like star that support the results above and point to interesting qualitative differences between hot Jupiters and sub-Jovian planets. We find that hot Neptunes with solar-metallicity hydrogen and helium envelopes have relatively more extended upper atmospheres than typical hot Jupiters, with a lower ionization fraction and higher abundances of escaping molecules. This is consistent with existing ultraviolet transit observations of warm Neptunes, and it might provide a way to use future observations and models to distinguish solar-metallicity atmospheres from higher-metallicity atmospheres.},

	abstract = {WASP-12 b is an ultra-hot Jupiter of special interest for atmospheric studies since it is on an inspiraling orbit in an extreme environment of intense radiation and circumstellar gas. Previously claimed detections of active mass-loss from this planet are controversial across the literature. To address this controversy, we obtain two new transit observations of WASP-12 b with the optical high-resolution PEPSI spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope. Contrary to previous work, we do not observe planetary H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption and rule out the amplitude of previously reported detections. Our non-detection may be limited by the sensitivity of our data or could indicate weaker mass-loss than suggested by previous studies. We conduct injection-recovery experiments to place constraints on the radial extent of WASP-12 b's escaping atmosphere as probed by Balmer lines, but find that our data do not have the sensitivity to probe down to the planet's Roche lobe. Using physically motivated models of atmospheric escape, we explore upper limit constraints on the planet's mass-loss rate and deem the data quality in the wavelength regime of Balmer lines insufficient to determine a physically meaningful constraint. We also conduct a spectral survey of other optical absorbers to trace atmospheric circulation but detect no additional absorption. We conclude that previous claims of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption from the atmosphere of WASP-12 b should be reevaluated. Given the anticipated line strength of Balmer/optical features, observing the atmosphere of this faint target will require stacking more observations even with the largest telescope facilities available.},

	abstract = {Methods. We developed the Cloudy e Hydro Ancora INsieme (CHAIN) model, which combines our 1D hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model with the non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) photoionisation and radiative transfer code Cloudy accounting for ionisation, dissociation, detailed atomic level populations, and chemical reactions for all chemical elements up to zinc. The hydrodynamic code is responsible for describing the outflow, while Cloudy solves the photoionisation and heating of planetary atmospheres. We applied CHAIN to model the upper atmospheres of a range of Neptune-like planets with masses between 1 and 50 M⊕, also varying the orbital parameters.
Results. For the majority of warm and hot Neptunes, we find slower and denser outflows, with lower ion fractions, compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic model alone. Furthermore, we find significantly different temperature profiles between CHAIN and the hydrodynamic model alone, though the peak values are similar for similar atmospheric compositions. The mass-loss rates predicted by CHAIN are higher for hot strongly irradiated planets and lower for more moderate planets. All differences between the two models are strongly correlated with the amount of high-energy irradiation. Finally, we find that the hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ionisation and heating.
Conclusions. The impact of the precise photoionisation treatment provided by Cloudy strongly depends on the system parameters. This suggests that some of the simplifications typically employed in hydrodynamic modelling might lead to systematic errors when studying planetary atmospheres, even at a population-wide level.},

The extended and revised grid of models consists of 10,235 points and covers a planetary mass range of up to 109 Earth masses, which allows one to outline the transition between low- and high-gravity hot planets in in short period orbits.
