def euv_surface_flux(F_x, updated=False):
    """
    Description:
        Given the x-ray surface flux, Chadney et al. give a relation to
        the euv flux. Note that flux is used instead of luminosity given
        the luminosities dependence on radius. If you wanted an euv
        luminosity, first convert to a surface flux, and then back to a
        luminosity after using Chadney's relationship.
    
    Arguments:
        F_x: stellar surface x-ray flux (in erg/s/cm**2)

    Returns:
        stellar surface euv flux (in erg/s/cm**2)
