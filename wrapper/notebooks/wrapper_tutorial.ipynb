Therefore, one needs to model from the bottom-up where this density resides in the planet's upper stratosphere. \n",

Thus, the only free parameter for the atmosphere then is the optical opacity, which we set to $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{opt.}} = 10^{-2}$, and can be modify with `sim.atmosphere.assign('kappa_opt', value)`. If altering the opacity then the solution will most likely need to be converged again as `Rmin`, where the `rho_rmin` maps to, will change.

    "`WARNING`: Currently only hydrogen has been vetted and is capable of being model in the relaxation code.\n",

    "Now the species in the atmosphere does not alter the stellar spectrum; however, the `spectrum` class also does the heavy lifting of calculating the frequency dependent cross section and outputting that at the approperaite abscissas for the Gauss-Legendre quadrature ionizationg and heating scheme. It is also convient to add the species first, so that later the boundaries of the ionizing spectrum can be determined based off the ionization thresholds of all the species in the planetary outflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a species for the `spectrum` to track use `spectrum.add_species(name)`, where name is the spectroscopic name of the species, i.e., atomic symbol + ionization stage, e.g., neutral hydrogen is 'H I', neutral helium is 'He I', signlely ionized helium is 'He II', triplely ionized carbon is 'C IV', etc."

    "\n",
    "The simulation can handle both monochromatic and multifrequency domains. So then the end user may chose how they wish to model the planetary wind's energy source. Although many may find the multifrequency results to be more exciting, there is moderate computational overhead invovled in such simulations. As such, a $\\texttt{pro}$ficient end user will ramp between systems with a \"decent\" monochromatic spectrum, and then polish up their desired system with a multifrequency spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to select the frequency domain can uses `spectrum.window(lob, upb=upb)` and provides a lower boundary (lob), and an upper boundary (upb) of the wavelengths in cgs, i.e., cm. If only a lower bound is provided an upper bound will be automatically determined by finding the lowest ionization threshold amoungst all the species in the spectrum, e.g., for a hydrogen only atmosphere the upper bound will be found to be ~91.2 nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a monochromatic source one can either provide a lower boundary and upper boundary equal to one another, or use `spectrum.monochrome(wavelength)`. All the user needs to provide then is the wavelength in cm that the monochromatic light acts at."

Therefore, just as the other parameters, the system needs to be slowly ramped up from its initial state to its final desired state. This is accomplished by calling the `wind_simulation.ramp_spectrum()` method, which ramps the spectrum to the current spectrum object stored in the `wind_simulation` object."

    "You have now run a full multifrequency simulation of atmospheric escape. As these require a relavtively modest amount of time, it's never a bad idea to save your results if they are interesting. Note that I used 'full_spectrum' for the folder, therefore this fill will be organized under `saves/full_spectrum/`. For the filename the system name, species, and a monkier for our selected spectrum have been combined to form a unquie filename. This will help us distinguish our full spectrum results from our monochromatic results. Consider using both creative filename and folder names (and trees of folders) to efficiently organize your results."

While the relaxation code working directory is aligned with the last simulation to have issued an execution, the each wrapper is capable of realigning the working directory to that of its own simulation.

The primary issue with these assertions is the reliance on using hardbody scattering as the means of calculating the collisionality of the gas. However, as the outflow is acknowledged to have been launched due to ionization the dominate collisional mechanism will rather be Coulomb scattering. Coulomb scatter is widely known to have a much large cross section than hardbody scattering, and is why these outflows are actually collisional despite objections otherwise.\n",

If your planet is somehow not collisional ($\\mathrm{Kn} \\gtrsim 1$) by the critical point (the dashed red vertical line), then we also assert the model is beginning to lose appropriateness. Our preferred model is the weighted scheme, which takes into account the neutral's colliding via hardbody and the ions with Coulomb. Note that while neutral-ion coupling has not been explained, the ions typically make up more than 90% of the outflow by the time hardbody scattering reaches $\\mathrm{Kn} \\sim 1$."
