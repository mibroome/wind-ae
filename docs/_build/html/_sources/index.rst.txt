Wind-AE Overview
===================================

**Wind-AE** (pronounced /windy/) stands for "wind atmospheric escape" and is a relatively fast 1D, steady-state, 
hydrodynamic, non-isothermal, Parker wind relaxation code for modeling atmospheric escape based on 
`Murray-Clay et al. (2009) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...693...23M/abstract>`_ . 
**Wind-AE** is a forward model that solves the energy conservation, momentum conservation, and ionization equilibrium equations 
at the substellar point using the `Numerical Recipes in C <https://numerical.recipes/>`_ relaxation method. This allows **Wind-AE** to quickly compute 
the atmosphere mass loss rate as well as upper atmosphere (:math:`\gtrsim 100` microbar) velocity, temperature, density, 
and ionization structure as a function of altitude. 


**Wind-AE** updates `Murray-Clay et al. (2009) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...693...23M/abstract>`_ to allow for the modeling of atomic metals and multifrequency XUV 
stellar spectra (`Broome et al. (2025) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...995..198B/abstract>`_). 
As a relaxation code, **Wind-AE** runs quickly, but the relaxation method is sensitive to having a good initial guess for 
the solution in order to numerically converge to the final solution.

With that in mind, we provide a number of starting points for simulations in the ``saves/`` folder and include 
a python wrapper (:ref:`relax_wind`) which handles ramping from the initial guess to the goal solution.

If you use **Wind-AE**, please consider citing `Broome et al. (2025) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...995..198B/abstract>`_.
